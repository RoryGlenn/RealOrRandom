Random Data Generator:
    To test a hypothesis in support/resistance, breakout flag and trend lines.

Summary: 
    Too often people will draw breakout flags, trend lines and support/resistance lines to make a prediction on future prices in cryptocurrency. 
    This software attempts to test these methods by assessing the accuracy of the users price prediction.
    If the users drawing methods are sound then they will be able to predict, within a specific percentage, future prices for each graph.

    During the test, a user will be given a mixture of real candle bar graphs and randomly generated candle bar graphs.
    The candle bar graph given to the user will contain only half of the visible data.

    No two tests will be exactly the same as it is impossible for anyone to know which symbols and time periods will be chosen by the software.


During the test:
    * The user will only be able to work on one graph at a time. 
        They can switch between timeframes, but they will not be able to go back or forwards to a new graph.
    
    * The user will have basic graphing tools.
    
    * All the users input on the page will be saved when they continue onto the next graph.
    
    * The user will have an additional notes section at the bottom of the page.
        This will be for the user to type anything they want. 
        This will have no effect on score.

The user will be required to fill out the following questions on each graph:
    * What are the upper bounds and what are the lower bounds for your price prediction 1, 5, 10, 30, 60 bars from the last candle bar?
    * Do you see a recognizable pattern in the graph? If so, what pattern is it?
    * Is this graph real or random?
    * How confident are you overall in your answers? 
        (confidence slider: 10% increments)

Evaluation:
    * The farther out the user can predict with accuracy, the more points are awarded.
    * The more precise the user is, the more point are awarded.

    For example, when the user decides to give an upper bound and lower bound for their price prediction, 
    the points awarded will be based on how close their prediction is to the last candle bars close price in the full graph.
    
    These percentages are based on real cryptocurrency prices: BTCUSD, ETHUSD, AAVEUSDT, DASHUSDT, ADAUSDT, LTCUSDT, XMRUSDT and more.
    By analyzing the standard deviation between these coins candle bars, we have constructed the following percentages...

    1 Candle Bar Prediction:
        4/4 points awarded: +- 0.5%
        3/4 points awarded: +- 1.0%
        2/4 points awarded: +- 1.5%
        1/4 points awarded: +- 2.0%
        0/4 points awarded: +- 2.5%

    5 Candle Bars Prediction:
        4/4 points awarded: +- %
        3/4 points awarded: +- %
        2/4 points awarded: +- %
        1/4 points awarded: +- %
        0/4 points awarded: +- %

    10 Candle Bars Prediction:
        4/4 points awarded: +- %
        3/4 points awarded: +- %
        2/4 points awarded: +- %
        1/4 points awarded: +- %
        0/4 points awarded: +- %

    30 Candle Bars Prediction:
        4/4 points awarded: +- %
        3/4 points awarded: +- %
        2/4 points awarded: +- %
        1/4 points awarded: +- %
        0/4 points awarded: +- %

    60 Candle Bars Prediction:
        4/4 points awarded: +- %
        3/4 points awarded: +- %
        2/4 points awarded: +- %
        1/4 points awarded: +- %
        0/4 points awarded: +- %                        


Ideas:
    After user has drawn a graph with s/r lines, have the bot generate a trend line start at 
    the same point and ending at the same point of the user.


Hypothesis: 
    Any user who takes this test will not be able to consistently predict future prices. 

Anecdotal:
    When a user draws a breakout flag, support/resistance lines, or just about anything else, they are seeing what they want to see. 
    This could be based on a mass number of things. Regardless, I believe that at the heart of this matter is a mixture of invested 
    interest and human psychology playing itself out.
    
    For example:
        If they user owns 10 Bitcoin on spot, they would much rather see the market go up in value because of their invested interest. 
        If they user is shorting Bitcoin in futures, they would much rather see the market go down in value because of their invested interest. 

        If their personality sways them towards doom and gloom, the user will filter the data of the given chart through a bearish vision.
        Bearish signs of any kind will be sought after while bullish indicators will be ignored and dismissed. 
        The same is true with the bullish personality type.

Conclusion:
    TBA...
