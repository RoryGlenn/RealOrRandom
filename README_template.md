## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

To test a hypothesis in support/resistance lines, breakout flags and trend lines.

Too often people will draw breakout flags, trend lines and support/resistance lines to make a prediction on future prices in cryptocurrency. 
This software attempts to test these methods by assessing the accuracy of the users price prediction.
If the users drawing methods are sound then they will be able to predict, within a specific percentage, future prices for each graph.

During the test, a user will be given a mixture of real candle bar graphs and randomly generated candle bar graphs. The randomly generated graphs will be considered our placebo, just like the standard Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Study.
The candle bar graph given to the user will contain only half of the visible data.
While the full graph will be revealed at the end of the test showing the accuracy of the users predictions.

No two tests will be exactly the same as it is impossible for anyone to know which symbols and time periods will be chosen by the software.



## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Add notes about how to use the system.

## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system.
