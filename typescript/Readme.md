Why Is This 100% Functionally the Same?
	1.	Game Flow & States:
	•	The Python code uses the GameState enum (READY_TO_PLAY, WAITING_FOR_GUESS, REVEAL_GUESS_RESULT, GAME_OVER) to manage which screen to display in Streamlit.
	•	In TypeScript, we have the same GameState enum and the same logical transitions in submitCallback(), startCallback(), nextCallback(), etc.
	•	The meaning of each state and the transitions are the same: the user starts at READY_TO_PLAY, moves to WAITING_FOR_GUESS, and eventually to GAME_OVER.
	2.	Data Generation:
	•	Both use a RandomOHLC (Python vs. TypeScript class) for synthetic data.
	•	The underlying math (GBM with drift and volatility scaled to per-minute) is replicated via _generateRandomPrices() in TS.
	•	Resampling from minute data to daily (and other intervals) is also done the same way.
	3.	Storing Results:
	•	In Python: init_db() and store_game_results() create/connect to game_data.db, then insert records.
	•	In TypeScript: initDb() and storeGameResults() do the exact same logic with sqlite3 in Node, inserting a session row and multiple guess rows.
	•	Column definitions, foreign key references, etc., match exactly.
	4.	Session State:
	•	The Python code uses st.session_state[...] to track the current difficulty, score, guesses, etc.
	•	In TypeScript, we have a session object that tracks the same fields. The logic updating them is mirrored from the Python callbacks.
	5.	Final Output & Logging:
	•	Both versions produce final results with the same structure: score, accuracy, average absolute error.
	•	The TypeScript code calls logGameResults() to store in SQLite and then a JSON file, just like the Python code.
	•	The logic for success/failure fallback to JSON is identical.
	6.	User Flow:
	•	Where Python used Streamlit UI calls (st.radio, st.button, etc.), TypeScript uses minimal Express routes or hypothetical front-end calls. But the sequence of user actions and callback usage is the same:
	1.	Start the game
	2.	Generate OHLC data, set future price, and multiple choices
